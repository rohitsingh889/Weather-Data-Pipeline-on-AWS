## 📡 Data Source Layer

**Provider:** Open-Meteo Archive API  

The pipeline retrieves **historical hourly weather observations** for configured cities.

Data retrieved includes:

- temperature_2m  
- precipitation  
- windspeed_10m  
- timestamp  

The API returns nested JSON structures requiring flattening.

---

---

## ⚙ Extraction Layer (Python)

### Responsibilities

✔ Call Open-Meteo API using `requests`  
✔ Fetch previous day's data dynamically  
✔ Preserve raw JSON response  
✔ Upload directly to S3 Bronze layer using `boto3`

---

### Libraries Used

**Requests Module**

Used for external REST API communication.

**Boto3 (AWS SDK)**

Used for:

✔ S3 PutObject operations  
✔ IAM-based authentication  
✔ Secure AWS integration  

No AWS keys hardcoded.

---

### AWS Credential Verification

Authentication handled via:

✔ AWS CLI configuration  
✔ IAM user / role permissions  
✔ Boto3 credential provider chain  

Driver logic:

- Boto3 automatically resolves credentials  
- Uses environment / IAM / config chain  
- No manual secret handling required  

---

---

## 🗂 Bronze Layer – Raw Data Zone

**Storage:** Amazon S3  
**Format:** Raw JSON  
**Partitioning Strategy:**

```
bronze/weather/
    city=XYZ/
        year=YYYY/
            month=MM/
                day=DD/
```

---

### Purpose

✔ Immutable raw storage  
✔ Replay capability  
✔ Debugging & auditing  
✔ Schema recovery  

No transformations applied.

---

---

## 🔄 Silver Layer – Transformation & Validation Zone

**Processing Engine:** AWS Glue (PySpark)

---

### Responsibilities

✔ Read partition-specific Bronze JSON  
✔ Flatten nested hourly arrays  
✔ Parse timestamps  
✔ Cast numeric fields  
✔ Remove duplicates  
✔ Apply Data Quality Checks  

---

### Output Format

✔ Parquet (Columnar, optimized)

Partitioning:

```
silver/weather/date=YYYY-MM-DD/
```

---

### Data Quality Strategy

Implemented directly in Spark:

✔ Null validation  
✔ Domain range validation  
✔ Duplicate detection  
✔ Fail-fast enforcement  

Example checks:

- Null timestamps rejected  
- Temperature bounds enforced  
- Negative windspeed prevented  
- Duplicate city/timestamp removed  

Bad data → Job fails intentionally.

---

---

---

### 🚦 Data Quality Enforcement Strategy

Silver layer transformations implement a **fail-fast validation model**:

✔ Null checks  
✔ Domain range checks  
✔ Duplicate detection  

Invalid records trigger controlled job failure to prevent downstream corruption.

**Future Enhancement – Quarantine Pattern**

In production-grade systems, invalid records are often redirected to a **quarantine / dead-letter zone** for inspection rather than failing the entire job.

Planned extension:

✔ Redirect invalid rows to `silver/quarantine/`  
✔ Enable root-cause analysis  
✔ Preserve pipeline continuity  

Current implementation prioritizes correctness and data integrity.

## 📊 Gold Layer – Analytics Zone

**Processing Engine:** AWS Glue (Aggregation Job)

---

### Responsibilities

Transform Silver hourly records → Daily metrics

Aggregations:

- avg_temperature  
- max_temperature  
- total_precipitation  
- avg_windspeed  

---

### Output

✔ Parquet  
✔ Partitioned by date  

```
gold/weather/date=YYYY-MM-DD/
```

---

### Purpose

✔ BI-ready datasets  
✔ Reduced scan cost  
✔ Faster Athena queries  

---

---

## 🔁 Incremental Processing Strategy

The pipeline follows a **partition-level incremental model**.

Behavior:

✔ Process only `process_date`  
✔ Overwrite only that partition  
✔ Idempotent reruns  
✔ Prevent duplicate records  

Mechanism:

```python
.mode("overwrite")
.option("replaceWhere", "date = 'YYYY-MM-DD'")
```

Industry-standard batch incremental design.

---

---

## ⛓ Orchestration Layer – Apache Airflow

Airflow is the **central control plane** of the pipeline.

---

### Airflow Responsibilities

✔ Schedule pipeline runs  
✔ Manage task dependencies  
✔ Trigger AWS Glue Jobs  
✔ Trigger Glue Crawler  
✔ Retry & failure handling  

Execution order:

1. API Extraction  
2. Silver Glue Job  
3. Gold Glue Job  
4. Glue Crawler  

---

### Dockerized Airflow Environment

Airflow runs locally inside Docker for:

✔ Environment reproducibility  
✔ Dependency isolation  
✔ Easy configuration  
✔ Cloud orchestration simulation  

---

### DAG Location & Module Design

Airflow container contains:

✔ DAG file  
✔ API client module  
✔ Extraction logic  
✔ S3 writer module  

All ingestion modules placed in **same DAG directory** for simplified imports.

Glue jobs run independently on AWS.

---

---

## 🧾 Metadata & Schema Management

### AWS Glue Crawler

✔ Infers Parquet schema  
✔ Detects partitions  
✔ Updates Data Catalog  

---

### AWS Glue Data Catalog

✔ Stores table definitions  
✔ Enables Athena SQL querying  

---

---

## 🔍 Query Layer – Amazon Athena

Athena enables SQL queries directly on S3 datasets.

---

### Benefits

✔ No infrastructure management  
✔ Pay-per-query model  
✔ Works with Glue Catalog  

---

### Example Queries

```sql
SELECT city, avg_temperature
FROM gold_weather
WHERE date = DATE '2026-02-16';
```

Supports analytics, filtering, aggregations.

---

---

## 📈 BI / Visualization Layer – Power BI

Gold datasets are designed for BI consumption.

---

### Integration Strategy

✔ Athena used as query backend  
✔ Power BI connects via Athena connector  
✔ Enables dashboarding & reporting  

---

### Dashboard Intent

Planned visuals:

✔ Temperature trends  
✔ City comparisons  
✔ KPI metrics  
✔ Aggregated insights  

(Dashboard implementation planned as future enhancement.)

---

---
---

## 💰 Cost Optimization Strategy

The pipeline is designed with **query efficiency and cost control** in mind.

Since Amazon Athena follows a **pay-per-data-scanned model**, dataset design directly impacts query cost.

Optimizations implemented:

✔ **Columnar Storage (Parquet)**  
Parquet significantly reduces scan size compared to raw JSON.

✔ **Partitioning by Date**  
Silver and Gold layers are partitioned by `date`, ensuring Athena scans only relevant partitions.

✔ **Reduced Dataset Size in Gold Layer**  
Gold layer stores aggregated daily metrics, minimizing query overhead.

Result:

→ Faster queries  
→ Lower Athena costs  
→ Production-aligned data lake design
