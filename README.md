---

### 1️⃣ Extract Phase – API Ingestion

✔ Weather data retrieved from Open-Meteo Archive API  
✔ Python used as the ingestion engine  
✔ REST calls executed via the `requests` module  
✔ Raw JSON responses preserved  

**Output:**

→ Raw JSON stored in Bronze layer (Amazon S3)

**S3 Folders**

**Bronze Layer**

![Project Overview](https://github.com/rohitsingh889/--weather-lake-pipeline/blob/main/PICS/bronze.png)

---

### 2️⃣ Transform Phase – Silver Processing (AWS Glue)

✔ Partition-specific Bronze data read  
✔ Nested arrays flattened  
✔ Timestamps parsed  
✔ Data types standardized  
✔ Duplicate records removed  
✔ Data quality checks enforced  

**Output:**

→ Cleaned Parquet datasets written to Silver layer

**Silver Layer**

---

### 3️⃣ Load Phase – Gold Aggregation (AWS Glue)

✔ Silver datasets aggregated into daily metrics  
✔ Business-friendly schema produced  
✔ Dataset optimized for analytics  

**Output:**

→ Analytics-ready Parquet datasets written to Gold layer

**Gold Layer**

![Project Overview](https://github.com/rohitsingh889/--weather-lake-pipeline/blob/main/PICS/gold.png)

---

### 4️⃣ Analytics Phase – Query & BI Consumption

✔ Glue Crawler infers schema  
✔ Glue Data Catalog stores metadata  
✔ Athena executes SQL queries  
✔ Power BI consumes Gold datasets  

**Purpose:**

→ Business intelligence & reporting

---




## 📡 Data Source Layer

**Provider:** Open-Meteo Archive API  

The pipeline retrieves **historical hourly weather observations** for configured cities.

Data retrieved includes:

- temperature_2m  
- precipitation  
- windspeed_10m  
- timestamp  

The API returns nested JSON structures requiring flattening.

---

## ⚙ Extraction Layer (Python)

### Responsibilities

✔ Call Open-Meteo API using `requests`  
✔ Fetch previous day’s data dynamically  
✔ Preserve raw JSON response  
✔ Upload directly to S3 Bronze layer using `boto3`

All source Python scripts are stored in the **same configured DAG location inside the Dockerized Airflow environment**, ensuring consistent execution and simplified orchestration.

---

### Libraries Used

**Requests Module**

Used for external REST API communication.

**Boto3 (AWS SDK)**

Used for:

✔ S3 PutObject operations  
✔ IAM-based authentication  
✔ Secure AWS integration  

No AWS keys are hardcoded.

---

### AWS Credential Verification

Authentication handled via:

✔ AWS CLI configuration  
✔ IAM user / role permissions  
✔ Boto3 credential provider chain  

Driver logic:

- Boto3 automatically resolves credentials  
- Uses environment / IAM / config chain  
- No manual secret handling required  

---

## 🗂 Bronze Layer – Raw Data Zone

**Storage:** Amazon S3  
**Format:** Raw JSON  

**Partitioning Strategy:**

```
bronze/weather/
    city=XYZ/
        year=YYYY/
            month=MM/
                day=DD/
```

### Purpose

✔ Immutable raw storage  
✔ Replay capability  
✔ Debugging & auditing  
✔ Schema recovery  

No transformations applied.

---

## 🔄 Silver Layer – Transformation & Validation Zone

**Processing Engine:** AWS Glue (PySpark)

### Responsibilities

✔ Read partition-specific Bronze JSON  
✔ Flatten nested hourly arrays  
✔ Parse timestamps  
✔ Cast numeric fields  
✔ Remove duplicates  
✔ Apply data quality checks  

---

### Output Format

✔ Parquet (columnar, optimized)

**Partitioning:**

```
silver/weather/date=YYYY-MM-DD/
```

---

### Data Quality Strategy

Implemented directly in Spark:

✔ Null validation  
✔ Domain range validation  
✔ Duplicate detection  
✔ Fail-fast enforcement  

Example checks:

- Null timestamps rejected  
- Temperature bounds enforced  
- Negative windspeed prevented  
- Duplicate city/timestamp removed  

Bad data → Job fails intentionally.

---

### 🚦 Data Quality Enforcement Strategy

Silver layer transformations implement a **fail-fast validation model**:

✔ Null checks  
✔ Domain range checks  
✔ Duplicate detection  

Invalid records trigger controlled job failure to prevent downstream corruption.

**Future Enhancement – Quarantine Pattern**

✔ Redirect invalid rows to `silver/quarantine/`  
✔ Enable root-cause analysis  
✔ Preserve pipeline continuity  

**Glue Jobs on AWS**

---

## 📊 Gold Layer – Analytics Zone

**Processing Engine:** AWS Glue (Aggregation Job)

### Responsibilities

Transform Silver hourly records → Daily metrics

Aggregations:

- avg_temperature  
- max_temperature  
- total_precipitation  
- avg_windspeed  

---

### Output

✔ Parquet  
✔ Partitioned by date  

```
gold/weather/date=YYYY-MM-DD/
```

**Gold Job Success**

![Project Overview](https://github.com/rohitsingh889/--weather-lake-pipeline/blob/main/PICS/gold%20job%20sucess.png)

---

### Purpose

✔ BI-ready datasets  
✔ Reduced scan cost  
✔ Faster Athena queries  

---

## 🔁 Incremental Processing Strategy

The pipeline follows a **partition-level incremental model**.

✔ Process only `process_date`  
✔ Overwrite only that partition  
✔ Idempotent reruns  
✔ Prevent duplicate records  

**Mechanism:**

```python
.mode("overwrite")
.option("replaceWhere", "date = 'YYYY-MM-DD'")
```

---

## ⛓ Orchestration Layer – Apache Airflow

Airflow acts as the **central control plane** of the pipeline, coordinating task execution and ensuring reliable workflow management.

## ▶️ How to Run This Project

This pipeline is designed to run using **Dockerized Apache Airflow locally** while interacting with **AWS services in the cloud**.

---

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

✔ Docker  
✔ Docker Compose  
✔ AWS CLI  
✔ Python (optional for local testing)

Verify installations:

```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
aws --version
```

---

### 2️⃣ Configure AWS Credentials

Authenticate your local environment with AWS:

```bash
aws configure
```

Provide:

✔ AWS Access Key  
✔ AWS Secret Key  
✔ Default Region (e.g., us-east-1)  
✔ Output Format (json)

Credentials are automatically used by **boto3** and Airflow tasks.

---

### 3️⃣ Start Airflow Environment

From the project root directory:

```bash
docker-compose up airflow-init
docker-compose up
```

Airflow services will start inside containers.

Access Airflow UI:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

Default login:

✔ Username: airflow  
✔ Password: airflow  

---

### 4️⃣ DAG & Script Placement

All pipeline Python scripts (extraction logic, Glue triggers, helpers) must reside inside the **configured DAG folder** mounted into Docker.

Example:

```
project-root/
    dags/
        weather_pipeline_dag.py
        extraction.py
        glue_helpers.py
```

This allows Airflow to automatically discover and execute tasks.

---

### 5️⃣ Enable & Trigger Pipeline

Inside Airflow UI:

✔ Locate the DAG  
✔ Toggle DAG to "ON"  
✔ Click **Trigger DAG**

Airflow will execute tasks sequentially:

Extraction → Glue Silver Job → Glue Gold Job → Crawler

---

### 6️⃣ Monitor Execution

Airflow provides built-in observability:

✔ Graph View → Task dependencies  
✔ Gantt View → Execution timing  
✔ Logs → Debugging & failures  

---

### 7️⃣ Query Results

After successful execution:

✔ Open Amazon Athena  
✔ Query `gold` table  

Example:

```sql
SELECT city, avg_temperature
FROM gold
ORDER BY avg_temperature DESC;
```

---

### 8️⃣ Failure Recovery

The pipeline supports safe reruns:

✔ Incremental partition overwrite  
✔ Idempotent job design  
✔ No duplicate record risk  

Simply re-trigger the DAG if needed.
